# redesigned-spork
This project I built a repository of the animals at the zoo. It holds all the animals in a vector 
and saves all the animals to a file if prompted that can later be used to load in the data if need 
be. I thought I made it user friendly and operates without error quick and efficiently. While I 
really like where the project is the system can be advanced with weights, notes, sex, and other 
facts about animals. I could add these into the animal class so it would be inherited to all the 
animals. I did not have any security features since I haven’t learned that yet. One part of the 
code I did have trouble in was reading in from a file. The reason I had problems was a do 
while loop wasn’t changing the bool properly and would loop back around and add in the 
same data as las loop since the index didn’t change. I was able to fix this by clearing the  
holder data after it was added to the vector. This project was a great learning project and a lot 
of the skills learned will transfer to future projects. Reading and writing to a file is something 
that will have to be done and I think I can do it pretty well. Also in this project I learned to 
use two different languages within the same program. I made this program readable with good 4
spacing and comments. There wasn’t much duplicate code so it was also maintainable and 
adaptable with a very minimal main function.
